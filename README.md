# Blog-as-a-Service (SaaS) with Django, Pelican, and Microservices

Welcome to the development guide for our Blog as a Service (SaaS) project. This guide will help you set up your environment, understand the architecture, and contribute to the development of our platform. Our platform will allow users to sign up/login, design their own blog, add pages, and connect their domain to go live. We will be using Django for the backend, Pelican for static site generation, and plain HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a platform where users can create, customize, and publish their blogs. The main features include:
- User authentication (sign up/login)
- Blog creation and customization
- Page management (adding, editing, deleting pages)
- Domain connection for live blogs

## Architecture

The project will follow a microservices architecture, divided into the following components:

1. **User Service**: Handles user authentication and profile management.
2. **Blog Service**: Manages blog creation, customization, and page management.
3. **Frontend Service**: Provides the user interface for blog design and management.
4. **Static Site Generator Service**: Uses Pelican to generate static sites for blogs.
5. **Domain Management Service**: Handles domain connection and configuration.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django
- **Static Site Generation**: Pelican
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Microservices Communication**: REST API

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-as-a-service.git
cd blog-as-a-service
```

### Environment Setup

#### Backend
1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Run the database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3. **Start the Django development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

#### Frontend
1. **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

#### Docker
1. **Build and start Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### Pelican Setup
1. **Install Pelican and create a new site:**
    ```bash
    pip install pelican
    pelican-quickstart
    ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Use ESLint for JavaScript code.
- Ensure all HTML/CSS follows W3C standards.

### Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for stable code.
- Use `dev` for ongoing development.
- Feature branches should be named `feature/<feature-name>`.

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
4. Push to your fork and create a pull request against the `dev` branch.
5. Ensure your code passes all CI checks.

## OWASP Top 10 Security Practices

### 1. Injection
- Use Django ORM to prevent SQL injection.
- Sanitize inputs in forms and APIs.

### 2. Broken Authentication
- Implement strong password policies.
- Use Django's built-in authentication mechanisms.

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Store passwords using Django's default password hashing.

### 4. XML External Entities (XXE)
- Avoid using XML parsers that are susceptible to XXE attacks.

### 5. Broken Access Control
- Use Django's permissions and authorization systems.
- Regularly audit permissions.

### 6. Security Misconfiguration
- Use Django's `SECURE_*` settings.
- Regularly update dependencies.

### 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Use Django templates to automatically escape HTML.
- Sanitize user inputs.

### 8. Insecure Deserialization
- Avoid using pickle or other insecure serialization methods.
- Validate all serialized data before deserialization.

### 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Regularly update dependencies.
- Use tools like `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities.

### 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
- Implement Django's logging framework.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
